Introduction
============



What is PyQtGraph?
------------------

PyQtGraph is a graphics and user interface library for :term:`Python` that provides functionality commonly required in engineering and science applications.
Primary goals are 

#. Provide fast, interactive graphics for displaying data such as plots, video, etc 
#. Provide tools to aid in rapid application development, for example, property trees such as used in Qt Designer

PyQtGraph makes heavy use of the :term:`Qt` platform for its high-performance graphics, via :term:`PyQt` or :term:`PySide` :term:`Python` bindings, and using :term:`numpy`/:term:`scipy` for heavy number crunching. In particular, PyQtGraph uses Qt's GraphicsView framework which is a highly capable graphics system on its own. PyQtGraph bring optimized and simplified primitives to this framework to allow data visualization with minimal effort. 

It is known to run on Linux, Windows, and OSX (:ref:`install`)


What can it do?
---------------

Amongst the core features of PyQtGraph are:

* Basic data visualization primitives: Images, line and scatter plots
* Fast enough for realtime update of video/plot data
* Interactive scaling and panning, averaging, FFTs, SVG/PNG export
* Widgets for marking and selecting plot regions
* Widgets for marking and selecting image region-of-interest and automatically slicing multi-dimensional image data
* Framework for building customized image region-of-interest widgets
* Docking system that replaces or complements Qt's dock system to allow more complex (and more predictable) docking arrangements
* ParameterTree widget for rapid prototyping of dynamic interfaces (Similar to the property trees in Qt Designer and many other applications)
* See :ref:`examples` for a demo


How does it compare to...
-------------------------

* matplotlib: For plotting, pyqtgraph is not nearly as complete/mature as matplotlib, but runs much faster. Matplotlib is more aimed toward making publication-quality graphics, whereas pyqtgraph is intended for use in data acquisition and analysis applications. Matplotlib is more intuitive for matlab programmers; pyqtgraph is more intuitive for python/qt programmers. Matplotlib (to my knowledge) does not include many of pyqtgraph's features such as image interaction, volumetric rendering, parameter trees, flowcharts, etc.

* pyqwt5: About as fast as pyqwt5, but not quite as complete for plotting functionality. Image handling in pyqtgraph is much more complete (again, no ROI widgets in qwt). Also, pyqtgraph is written in pure python, so it is more portable than pyqwt, which often lags behind pyqt in development (I originally used pyqwt, but decided it was too much trouble to rely on it as a dependency in my projects). Like matplotlib, pyqwt (to my knowledge) does not include many of pyqtgraph's features such as image interaction, volumetric rendering, parameter trees, flowcharts, etc.

(My experience with these libraries is somewhat outdated; please correct me if I am wrong here)
