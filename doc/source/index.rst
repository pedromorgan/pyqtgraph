Welcome to PyQtGraph
==========================================

PyQtGraph is a pure :term:`Python` graphics and GUI library built on :term:`Qt`, :term:`PyQt` / :term:`PySide`, :term:`numpy` and :term:`scipy`. It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications. Despite being written entirely in :term:`Python`, the library is very fast due to its heavy leverage of :py:mod:`numpy` for number crunching and Qt's :qt:`QGraphicsView` framework for fast display.
